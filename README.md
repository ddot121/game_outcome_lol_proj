# Game Outcome Predictor
A personal project by Donnie Aikins predicting the outcome of games in League of Legends based on bot lane success (Summoner's Rift)

# League of Legends
League of Legends (LOL) is a MOBA developed by Riot Games.
Summoner's Rift is a 5v5 game mode in LOL where the objective of both teams is to fight against each other and ultimately destroy the other team's base (also known as the nexus).
Each game is to be influenced by champion selection, objective completion (Turrets, Dragons, Baron etc), team gold count and other metrics.

A standard game of Summoner's Rift splits 5 players into each role and their respective lane:
* Top - Top Lane
* Jungle - Jungle
* Mid - Middle Lane (Mid)
* ADC (Attack Damage Carry)- Bottom Lane (Bot lane)
* Support - Bottom Lane (Bot)

The state of the game has far surpassed its traditional association of roles due to innovations of pro players, curiosities of players and balance changes. However,
a brief description of the roles should serve as a clarification of the setup of a Summoner's Rift game.

* Top: Usually a tankier/bruiser-like champion (often melee), employing rich strategies to the game such as split-pushing, leading team fights or targetting the carry of the opposing team. _e.g. Darius, Garen, Mordekaiser_
* Jungle: Although not given a lane, the Jungle is expected to level up through killing monsters that reside in between lanes and provides value to the team through assisting other laners to get an advantage and securing team objectives such as Dragons, Baron, Scuttler (which give temporary bonus stats). _e.g. Kha'Zix, Amumu, Warwick_ 
* Mid: Commonly a champion who deals burst damage through Ability Power and roams into other lanes (like a jungler) to provide support for the other champions. _e.g. Qiyana, Lux, Ahri_
* ADC: Like the Mid laner, the ADC is expected to *lead* the team through causing the *most* damage (commonly Attack Damage). Because they are expected to build only offensive items, they are often left to be squishy - not have a lot of health and thus targetted frequently. _e.g. Aphelios, Jhin, Ezreal_
* Support: Help the ADC in the bot lane, dominate map control through providing vision (warding) and utilising the champions crowd control if possible. _e.g. Rell, Nautilus, Thresh_

The following is a standard map of Summoner's Rift to provide more insight. And of course, watching a few videos on YouTube or playing the game yourself wouldn't hurt! :D

# Motivation
I have been playing League of Legends since season 10 where I was fortunte enough to reach Gold IV playing only the Support Role. 
As I write this now (Season 12), [I am a Silver 1](https://euw.op.gg/summoners/euw/ddot) still playing Support.
A lot of my games were and still are heavily influenced through the success of my neighbouring laner, the ADC. It would be frustating to play sometimes being a Support because it isn't in the role responsibilities to _carry_ (lead) a game.
So, as an attempt to transition into a more game-dominant role, I decided to try the ADC role, mainly playing Aphelios.

It was not until I played a couple of games that I realised that succeeding in the laning phase is not as easy as one may think; having to farm minions in lane whilst having two opposing champions hunt you down. 

_Oh, did I forget to mention, including the Jungler too?_

Your health bar is as squishy as a fresh dumpling, meaning you get one-shotted by opposing enemies.
Your damage is slim to none with the current state of tanks and their game-changing items.
Everyone has multiple dashes and stuns to chase you down (_You don't_).
The current meta of roaming supports means that you are in lane by yourself most of the time, vulnerable to dives or ganks.

...The list goes on.

Eventually you'll find yourself to be 0/11/2 staring at ![DEFEAT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59264543/170416587-80807901-a349-414f-a106-aaf829de769d.png)

Was it because of the matchup? Was it because of the team composition? Was it because of team gold earned at 10 minutes?

These are metrics that I want to explore that will hopefully help myself and the LOL community before queuing up for another Ranked game.
